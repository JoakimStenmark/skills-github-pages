### [Physics Gun Testing Facility | School project at Yrgo - Gothenburg](https://github.com/JoakimStenmark/JoakimStenmark/tree/main/PhysicsGun)
##### Mar 2021 – Apr 2021 <br>
#### First person puzzle game made in Unreal 4. <br>
I worked as solo developer on this one, relying only on unreals templates and what free graphical assets i could find. The Scripting, level design, audio and music design are all done by me. In this project i also learned alot about materials and how to modify them. <br>
Full game available on [Itch.Io](https://joakimstenmark.itch.io/physics-gun-testing-facility) <br>
